# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains how we handle user information.

## Information Collection

We collect certain non-personally identifiable information using Firebase Analytics to help us improve our application and understand how it is being used. This may include:

- Usage statistics (e.g., app opens, feature usage)
- Device information (e.g., model, operating system version)
- General location data (country level)
- Crash reports

We do not collect or store any personal information that can directly identify individual users.

## User-Submitted Merchant Information

Our application allows users to voluntarily submit information about merchant locations. This information is provided willingly and does not include personal data. By submitting this information, users acknowledge that:

- The submitted information will be made publicly available through our application.
- We do not verify the accuracy of user-submitted information.
- We are not responsible for the content of the submitted information.
- This submitted information is not considered personal data and is not subject to the same protections as personal information.

## Information Usage

The analytics data we collect is used solely for the purpose of improving our application and understanding user behavior. This data is not shared with third parties except as necessary to provide analytics services through Firebase.

The merchant information voluntarily submitted by users is used solely for the purpose of displaying merchant locations within the application.

## Data Storage and Security

Analytics data is stored securely on Firebase servers in accordance with Google's data protection policies. We do not have direct access to individual user data.

## User Rights

As we do not collect personal data, there are no personal data access, correction, or deletion rights to exercise. However, you can opt out of analytics collection through your device settings.
