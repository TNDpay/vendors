# TND Copyright Policy

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to TND (the "App"). This copyright policy ("Policy") outlines how we respect and protect the intellectual property rights of others and how you can report any copyright infringement on our platform.

## 2. Our Commitment

We respect the intellectual property rights of others and expect our users to do the same. It is our policy to respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) or other applicable intellectual property laws. We will take appropriate action, which may include removing or disabling access to the allegedly infringing content and terminating accounts of repeat infringers.

## 3. Reporting Copyright Infringement

If you believe that any content available on our App infringes your copyright, you may send a written notification of such infringement to our designated Copyright Agent.

Your notification must include the following information:

1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that is allegedly infringed.
2. A description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed, or if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works.
3. A description of the material that you claim is infringing and where it is located on the App, sufficient for us to locate the material.
4. Your address, telephone number, and email address.
5. A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
6. A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notification is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

## 4. Counter-Notification

If you believe that your content was removed or access to it was disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may submit a counter-notification to our Copyright Agent. The counter-notification must include the following:

1. Your physical or electronic signature.
2. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled.
3. A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material.
4. Your name, address, telephone number, and email address.
5. A statement that you consent to accept service of process from the person who provided the original notification of alleged infringement or an agent of such person.

## 5. Repeat Infringer Policy

In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, we have adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances, users who are deemed to be repeat infringers. We may also, at our sole discretion, limit access to the App and/or terminate the accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.

## 6. Modifications to Policy

We reserve the right to modify or update this Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the updated Policy on our App. Your continued use of the App after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Policy.
